# A better way to view your favorite xkcd comics!

Solo project built from scratch with React, Redux, Tailwind, Node, Express and PostgreSQL.

The site loads random comics and includes infinite scroll, night mode and search.

Heroku scheduler runs a daily function to look for new comics and adds them to the database.

Future functionality for "recaptioning" and "favoriting".
